	abstract = {This study presents the first causal evidence of the impact on arrest rates of a sectoral training program that was implemented using a randomized control trial. The results indicate that, among those with a prior criminal record, individuals in the treatment group were two-fifths as likely to be arrested post-randomization as those assigned to the control group. Among the overall population, arrest probabilities decreased by one-half. We explore potential mechanisms for this effect and find suggestive evidence in favor of the training program’s impact on earnings, as well as peer effects from other trainees.},

	abstract = {With the rise of the digital job search market, new opportunities for signaling skills and competencies to employers have emerged. In this paper, we examine listed skills on individuals’ LinkedIn profiles in the United States between 2015 and 2021, both those members add themselves and skills for which they are endorsed from others in their network. We use an inverse probability weighted proportional hazards model with time varying covariates to estimate the relationship between listed skills on shortening employment gaps (time between jobs). We find that, for self-added and peer-endorsed skills respectively, an additional ten skills on the profile decreases median employment gap duration by about 0.7 and 0.4 months, from a median baseline of around 6 months gap. Individuals with no education listed on their profile have the largest benefit from listed skills in terms of reducing employment gaps. Disruptive tech and soft skills also are related to higher returns. Additionally, skills added during the employment break have a substantially stronger relationship than pre-existing added skills. More experienced workers have larger returns than less experienced workers, consistent with the hypothesis that these skills are otherwise difficult to signal to potential employers. These findings are consistent with online job markets’ use of technology offering more efficient ways to signal skills, shortening time to reemployment.},
