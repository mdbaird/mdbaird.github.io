I am a Senior Staff Economist at LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Research Institute, where I lead the Economic Opportunity Research Program. With over 15 years of experience in labor economics, I’ve conducted policy research across tech, academia, and the non-profit sector, using econometric methods and economic modeling to understand and improve labor market outcomes.

My work focuses on expanding economic opportunity, including examining disparities by gender, race, education, and socioeconomic status. I’ve also conducted research on education policy and health access and outcomes.

I have authored dozens of peer-reviewed journal articles as well as reports for RAND and LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. My research has been cited thousands of times and I have presented at top academic conferences, universities, corporations, and policy forums. At RAND, I served as principal or co-principal investigator on eleven funded projects totaling several million dollars.

In addition to my research, I’ve taught Ph.D.-level courses in labor economics, applied econometrics, and causal inference. I hold a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
