I am a Senior Staff Economist on LinkedIn's Economic Graph Research Institute team where I lead the equity research program. I have spent over 15 years conducting policy research in labor economics using econometric methodology and economic modeling, and have worked in tech, academia, and in the non-profit research institute space. My research has focused primarily on policy to improve outcomes along several dimensions of equity, including gender, race, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status. My past work also spans education policy and health access and outcomes.

I have published dozens of peer-reviewed journal articles as well as dozens of RAND and Economic Graph reports. My work has been cited thousands of times in academic journals, and I have presented my research many times at top academic conferences, in universities, to companies, and at other events. While at RAND, as principal or co-principal investigator, I brought in eleven research grants with a total worth of millions of dollars. I have taught several doctoral courses on labor economics, applied econometrics, and causal inference. I have a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
