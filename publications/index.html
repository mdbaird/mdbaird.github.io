In this paper, we examine listed skills on individuals’ LinkedIn profiles in the United States between 2015 and 2021, both those members add themselves and skills for which they are endorsed from others in their network. We use an inverse probability weighted proportional hazards model with time varying covariates to estimate the relationship between listed skills on shortening employment gaps (time between jobs). We find that, for self-added and peer-endorsed skills respectively, an additional ten skills on the profile decreases median employment gap duration by about 0.7 and 0.4 months, from a median baseline of around 6 months gap. Individuals with no education listed on their profile have the largest benefit from listed skills in terms of reducing employment gaps. Disruptive tech and soft skills also are related to higher returns. Additionally, skills added during the employment break have a substantially stronger relationship than pre-existing added skills. More experienced workers have larger returns than less experienced workers, consistent with the hypothesis that these skills are otherwise difficult to signal to potential employers. These findings are consistent with online job markets’ use of technology offering more efficient ways to signal skills, shortening time to reemployment.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_publicly_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Do publicly funded neighborhood investments impact individual-level health-related outcomes?

We use longitudinal data from the Pittsburgh Research on Neighborhood Change and Health (PHRESH) studies to assess the relationship between publicly funded neighborhood investments between 2011 and 2018 and five health-related outcomes: food insecurity, stress, perceived neighborhood safety, neighborhood satisfaction, and dietary quality. We additionally determine whether the distance between an individual’s place of residence and the investment affects the magnitude of associations. Using individual and year fixed effects models, we find that when measured at the neighborhood level, an increase by one standard deviation (SD) in investments (about $130 million) is associated with decreased food insecurity (−0.294 SD), increased safety (0.231 SD), and increased neighborhood satisfaction (0.201 SD) among adults who remain in the study for at least two waves of data collection. We also analyze specific investment types and find that commercial investments are largely driving the changes in food insecurity, safety, and neighborhood satisfaction, while business and residential investments are correlated with the decrease in stress.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="siddiqi_food_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Food insecurity among aging SNAP participants and eligible nonparticipants in two predominantly low-Income Black neighborhoods: Implications for SNAP enrollment and outreach for older adults</div> <div class="author"> Sameer M.

Despite these benefits, many older Americans who are eligible for SNAP do not participate in the program. Few studies have explored household factors and food insecurity outcomes associated with nonparticipation among older Black Americans. Objectives The study aim was to explore changes in food insecurity and related financial hardship outcomes between 2020 and 2021 among SNAP participants, eligible nonparticipants, and ineligible nonparticipants; compare reasons for not participating in SNAP; and to compare household factors associated with SNAP nonparticipation. Methods Longitudinal design examining data from 2020 and 2021 to assess changes in food insecurity over the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Participants/setting Participants were 528 adults (aged 30 to 97 years) in households randomly selected from a listing of all residential addresses in two predominantly Black neighborhoods with lower incomes in Pittsburgh, PA, and surveyed between March to May 2020 and May to December 2021. Main outcome measures Food security was measured using the validated 6-item US Department of Agriculture Adult Food Security Survey Module. Statistical analyses performed Findings are based on a descriptive analysis of food security and related indicators. Statistical testing was performed to assess differences between SNAP participation status and individual characteristics, food security, and financial hardship using Wald F test for continuous measures and Pearson χ2 test for categorical measures. A multivariable linear model was used to assess the association of SNAP participation and eligibility status with change in food insecurity. Results In cross-sectional analyses of 2021 data, no differences were observed between SNAP participants and eligible nonparticipants for food insecurity, food bank use, mean weekly food spending per person, and difficulty paying for basics. However, with respect to changes in food insecurity over the course of the pandemic, SNAP participants experienced a greater improvement in mean food security scores between 2020 and 2021 (–0.52 reduction in mean food insecurity score or a 16% improvement in food security; P ≤ 0.05) relative to SNAP-eligible nonparticipants. Perceived ineligibility (71.3%) and perceived lack of need (23%) were the most common reasons for not participating in SNAP. Conclusions More than one-third of SNAP participants and eligible nonparticipants experienced food insecurity and financial hardship. However, there were differences in the changes in food insecurity between these groups.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baird_optimal_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Optimal allocation of seats in the presence of peer effects: Evidence from a job training program</div> <div class="author"> Matthew D.

Methods A probability-based sample (N = 1751) of the US population age 20 and over was followed prospectively from February 2019 (T1), with subsequent interviews in May 2020 (T2) and August 2020 (T3). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess prospective relationships between T1 SPD with experiences of disruption of employment, health care, and childcare at T2. Binary logistic regression was then used to assess relationships of T1 SPD, and socioeconomic status and T2 pandemic-related stressors with T3 SPD. Results At T1, SPD was associated with age, race/ethnicity, and household income. SPD at T1 predicted disruption of employment (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4–3.8) and health care (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4–7.1) at T2. SPD at T1 (OR 10.2, 95% CI 4.5–23.3), low household income at T1 (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1–6.4), disruption of employment at T2 (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4–7.6), and disruption of healthcare at T2 (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5–7.2) were all significantly associated with elevated risk for SPD at T3. Conclusions Elevated risk for SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to multiple psychological and social pathways that are likely to interact over the life course. Policies and interventions that target individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions as well as those experiencing persistent unemployment should be high priorities in the mental health response to the pandemic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lytell_retention_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Retention of racial-ethnic minorities in the regular army</div> <div class="author"> Maria C.

This response is mainly from states with decreased benefits; colleges with more veterans, and colleges whose pre‐change tuition was above the state maximum but below the new nationwide level had a pass‐through rate of 8 percent.

In the United States, these credentials typically take the form of licenses and certifications. Although a critical part of the workforce landscape, the literature on the returns to credentials is inadequate, with prior research typically relying on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions which do not sufficiently control for selection. Using questions that identify credential receipt from the 2015 and 2016 United States’ Current Population Surveys, we construct an instrumental variable of local peer influence using the within-labor market credential rate of individuals sharing the same sociodemographic characteristics, while controlling for the same group’s average wages and a suite of demographic and geographic controls. We use this instrument in a marginal treatment effects estimator, which allows for estimation of the average treatment effect and determines the direction of selection, and we estimate the effects of credentials on labor market outcomes. We find large, meaningful returns in the form of increased probability of individual employment, an effect which is concentrated primarily among women. The effect of having a credential on log wages is higher for those in the sub-baccalaureate labor market, suggesting the potential role of occupational credentials as an alternative path to marketable human capital and a signal of skills in the absence of a bachelor’s degree.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="fischer_use_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Use of and willingness to use video telehealth through the COVID-19 pandemic</div> <div class="author"> Shira H.

The city of New Orleans implemented a job training programme funded by the U.S. Department of labour Workforce Innovation Fund. They screened potential trainees for suitability and likelihood of completing and benefiting from training. They selected and developed curriculum with input from local firms. The city implemented the training as a randomized controlled trial. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the training on employment, earnings, and industry of employment, both overall and separately by baseline employment status. We find overall positive effects for earnings, driven by those who did not have a job at the time of training enrolment. We also find positive employment effects for short-term unemployed workers.

This paper examines changes in psychological distress depending on job loss among a cohort of randomly selected residents living in nine predominantly African American low‐income neighborhoods in Pittsburgh PA across four waves between 2013 and 2020. Between 2013 and 2016, we found an increase in psychological distress after job loss in line with the literature. In contrast, between 2018 and 2020 we found change in psychological distress did not differ by employment loss. However, residents who had financial concerns and lost their jobs had the largest increases in psychological distress, while residents who did not have serious financial concerns—potentially due to public assistance—but experienced job loss had no increase in distress, a better outcome even than those that retained their jobs. Using partial identification, we find job loss during the pandemic decreased psychological distress for those without serious financial concerns. This has important policy implications for how high‐risk persons within low‐income communities are identified and supported, as well as what type of public assistance may help.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baird_examining_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Examining the impact of employment status on sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in two low-income neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA</div> <div class="author"> Matthew D Baird, Tamara Dubowitz, Jonathan Cantor, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

The current study examines employment and its association with sleep quality during the initial months of the pandemic in a low-income, predominantly African American adult sample. Methods In the early months of COVID-19 (March to May 2020), we administered a survey to an ongoing, longitudinal cohort of older adults to assess the impact of COVID-related changes in employment on self-reported sleep quality (N = 460; 93.9% African American). Participants had prior sleep quality assessed in 2018 and a subset also had sleep quality assessed in 2013 and 2016. Primary analyses focused on the prevalence of poor sleep quality and changes in sleep quality between 2018 and 2020, according to employment status. Financial strain and prior income were assessed as moderators of the association between employment status and sleep quality. We plotted trend lines showing sleep quality from 2013 to 2020 in a subset (n = 339) with all four waves of sleep data available. Results All participants experienced increases in poor sleep quality between 2018 and 2020, with no statistical differences between the employment groups. However, we found some evidence of moderation by financial strain and income. The trend analysis demonstrated increases in poor sleep quality primarily between 2018 and 2020. Conclusion Sleep quality worsened during the pandemic among low-income African American adults. Policies to support the financially vulnerable and marginalized populations could benefit sleep quality.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cantor_what_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">What is associated with changes in food security among low-income residents of a former food desert?</div> <div class="author"> Jonathan Cantor, Bonnie Ghosh-Dastidar, Gerald Hunter, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

Building on an established cohort of randomly selected households from a low-income, predominantly Black neighborhood, we examined household food security, distance to where study participants reported doing their major food shopping, and prices at stores where they shopped. Data from the Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Eating, Shopping, and Health study for years 2011, 2014 and 2018 was limited to residents of the neighborhood that began as a food desert (i.e., low access to healthy foods), but acquired a full-service supermarket in 2013. We calculated descriptive statistics and compared study participants in the former food desert neighborhood whose food security improved to those whose food security did not improve across survey waves. We estimated cross sectional linear regressions using all waves of data to assess food security level among study participants. Distance to major food shopping store was positively associated with food security (p \textless 0.05) while food-store prices were not significantly associated with food security. Findings suggest that for predominantly low-income residents, food secure individuals traveled further for their major food shopping.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baird_societal_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Societal impact of research funding for women’s health in rheumatoid arthritis</div> <div class="author"> Matthew D.

Using this approach, the gender gap in STEM workforce participation decreases substantially because women are more likely to work in the periphery.

Using detailed administrative records of undergraduate students, we document that minority students and non-minority students take divergent pathways through the STEM major. Specifically, minority students take fewer lower division STEM courses in their early career, which delays their enrollment in upper division STEM courses and leads to lower graduation probability in STEM within four years and higher dropout rates. We investigate the potential reasons (and/or predictors) for this apparent discrepancy. To do so, we first identify a student’s major-specific Individual Performance Potential (IPP) from lower division course regressions. We find that once we control for the heterogeneity in the IPP’s and a rich set of term level controls, the differences in intermediate outcomes (declared major, STEM course load) between minority and non-minority students largely disappear, but that some of the gap in outcomes persist, with the exception being in graduation from STEM within five years, for which minority students are more likely after controlling for these factors. Our findings suggest that minority STEM majors would benefit from additional support such as early career course advising.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baird_trade-offs_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Trade-offs in selecting the number of years for estimation of teacher effectiveness</div> <div class="author"> Matthew Baird, and John Engberg </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Education Economics</em>, Jul 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09645292.2021.1897526" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09645292.2021.1897526" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The number of years to estimate value-added measures (VAM) has received insufficient attention.

This is the first natural experiment to examine the impact of neighborhood revitalization on cardiometabolic outcomes in residents from 2 predominantly African American neighborhoods, one of which has experienced significant revitalization (intervention), whereas the other has not (comparison). Methods The sample included 532 adults (95% African American, 80% female, mean age=58.9 years) from 2 sociodemographically similar, low-income neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA, with preintervention and postintervention measures (2016 and 2018) of BMI, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and covariates. Data were collected in 2016 and 2018 and analyzed in 2020. Results Difference-in-difference analyses showed significant improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in intervention residents relative to that in the comparison neighborhood (β=3.88, 95% CI=0.47, 7.29). There was also a significant difference-in-difference estimate in diastolic blood pressure (β=3.00, 95% CI=0.57, 5.43), with residents of the intervention neighborhood showing a greater increase in diastolic blood pressure than those in the comparison neighborhood. No statistically significant differences were found for other outcomes. Conclusions Investing in disadvantaged neighborhoods has been suggested as a strategy to reduce health disparities. Using a natural experiment, findings suggest that improving neighborhood conditions may have a mixed impact on certain aspects of cardiometabolic health. Findings underscore the importance of examining the upstream causes of health disparities using rigorous designs and longer follow-up periods that provide more powerful tests of causality.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="siddiqi_snap_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">SNAP participants and high levels of food Insecurity in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic</div> <div class="author"> Sameer M.

Food insecurity, which entails having limited or uncertain access to a sufficient quantity of nutritious food, is a key pandemic-related consequence. We examined how people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been affected by the pandemic, particularly Black participants and participants residing in food deserts. Methods Using survey data from a longitudinal cohort study of predominantly Black low-income adults aged ≥18 residing in urban food deserts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we examined changes in food insecurity and SNAP participation before COVID-19 (2018) and early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March–May 2020). We modeled changes in food insecurity from 2018 to 2020 via covariate-adjusted logistic regression. Results Food insecurity increased significantly among participants enrolled in SNAP and surveyed in both 2018 and 2020 (from 25.9% in 2018 to 46.9% in 2020; P \textless .001). Compared with cohort participants not enrolled in SNAP at both points, cohort participants enrolled in SNAP in 2018 and 2020 had the highest rates of using a food bank in 2020 (44.4%) and being newly food insecure in 2020 (28.9%) (ie, they were food insecure in 2020 but not in 2018). Conclusions Food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic increased among low-income Black households enrolled in SNAP and residing in a food desert. Public health recovery efforts might focus on modifying SNAP to improve the food security of people experiencing poverty.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="richardson_improvements_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Improvements in neighborhood socioeconomic conditions may improve resident diet</div> <div class="author"> Andrea S.

We capitalized on a natural experiment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in which 1 neighborhood experienced substantial investments and a sociodemographically similar neighborhood that did not, to examine pathways from neighborhood investments to changed NSECs and changed dietary behavior. We examined differences between renters and homeowners. Data were from a random sample of households (n = 831) in each of these low-income Pittsburgh neighborhoods that were surveyed in 2011 and 2014. Structural equation modeling tested direct and indirect pathways from neighborhood to resident dietary quality, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographics, with multigroup testing by homeowners versus renters. Neighborhood investments were directly associated with improved dietary quality for renters (β = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05, 0.50) and homeowners (β = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.92). Among renters, investments also were associated with dietary quality through a positive association with commercial prices (β = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.54) and a negative association with residential prices (β = −0.30, 95% CI: −0.59, −0.004). Among homeowners, we did not observe any indirect pathways from investments to dietary quality through tested mediators. Investing in neighborhoods may support resident diet through improvements in neighborhood commercial environments for renters, but mechanisms appear to differ for homeowners.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="dubowitz_food_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Food insecurity in a low-income, predominantly African American cohort following the COVID-19 pandemic</div> <div class="author"> Tamara Dubowitz, Madhumita Ghosh Dastidar, Wendy M.

To examine the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on food insecurity among a predominantly African American cohort residing in low-income racially isolated neighborhoods. Methods. Residents of 2 low-income African American food desert neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were surveyed from March 23 to May 22, 2020, drawing on a longitudinal cohort (n = 605) previously followed from 2011 to 2018. We examined longitudinal trends in food insecurity from 2011 to 2020 and compared them with national trends. We also assessed use of food assistance in our sample in 2018 versus 2020. Results. From 2018 to 2020, food insecurity increased from 20.7% to 36.9% (t = 7.63; P \textless .001) after steady declines since 2011. As a result of COVID-19, the United States has experienced a 60% increase in food insecurity, whereas this sample showed a nearly 80% increase, widening a preexisting disparity. Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (52.2%) and food bank use (35.9%) did not change significantly during the early weeks of the pandemic. Conclusions. Longitudinal data highlight profound inequities that have been exacerbated by COVID-19. Existing policies appear inadequate to address the widening gap.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="breslau_longitudinal_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A longitudinal study of psychological distress in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic</div> <div class="author"> Joshua Breslau, Melissa L.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress and identify vulnerable groups using longitudinal data to account for pre-pandemic mental health status. Clinically significant psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler-6 in a national probability sample of adults in the United States at two time points, February 2019 (T1) and May 2020 (T2). To identify increases in distress, psychological distress during the worst month of the past year at T1 was compared with psychological distress over the past 30-days at T2. Survey adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics at T1 (gender, age, race, and income) and census region at T2 with within-person increases in psychological distress. The past-month prevalence of serious psychological distress at T2 was as high as the past-year prevalence at T1 (10.9% vs. 10.2%). Psychological distress was strongly associated across assessments (X2(4) = 174.6, p \textless .0001). Increase in psychological distress above T1 was associated with gender, age, household income, and census region. Equal numbers of people experienced serious psychological distress in 30-days during the pandemic as did over an entire year prior to the pandemic. Mental health services and research efforts should be targeted to those with a history of mental health conditions and groups identified as at high risk for increases in distress above pre-pandemic levels.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cohen_surgical_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Surgical and anesthesia workforce and provision of surgical services in rural communities: A mixed‐methods examination</div> <div class="author"> Catherine Cohen, Matthew Baird, Nirabh Koirola, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

This mixed‐methods study describes the distribution of the surgical and anesthesia workforce and qualitatively explores how such workforce and other factors influence rural hospitals’ provision of surgical services. Methods We calculated provider counts by county from the Area Health Resource File. Using American Hospital Association survey data, we sampled rural hospitals, stratified by critical access status and state policies. We conducted qualitative semistructured interviews with administrators at 16 hospitals and performed directed content analysis of factors influencing surgical services provision at rural hospitals. Findings Within rural counties, 55.1% of counties had no surgeon, 81.2% had no anesthesiologist, and 58.1% had no Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). Administrators reported that rural hospitals struggled to provide many surgical services given lack of subspecialty surgeons and adequate postsurgical care. Rural hospitals likely struggle to generate volumes necessary to support safe and profitable subspecialty surgery programs. Anesthesia services were not reported as a current limitation given that CRNAs in particular had strong, diverse skills sets and many hospitals allowed high CRNA autonomy. However, meeting anesthesia needs for emergency surgeries and 24‐hour obstetrics posed significant challenges. Conclusions While rural hospitals reported meeting community needs for elective and noncomplex surgeries, rural hospitals continued to face significant challenges providing subspecialty surgeries, emergency surgeries, and 24‐hour obstetrical services.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baird_research_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Research funding for women’s health: A modeling study of societal impact: Findings for coronary artery disease</div> <div class="author"> Matthew D.

We add to HOPE VI research by examining the impacts of a large set of public–private real estate investments, including HOPE VI, made over a 16-year period in a distressed neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Hill District). We estimate the effects of \468 million additional public–private investments that Hill District received compared with a demographically similar neighborhood on sales prices, rental prices, and crime. We find large, statistically significant impacts of these investments on residential sales prices, commercial sales prices, and on rental prices, and a marginally significant yet meaningful decline in nonviolent arrests. For each \10 million of public–private investment, we find a 0.95%, 2.7%, and 0.55% increase in residential sales prices, commercial sales prices, and rental prices, respectively. Given the accumulated difference over 16 years of \468 million in these investments across the two neighborhoods, the percentage increases amount to large changes in prices over that time.

Data Sources/Study Setting Secondary data from two national surveys of anesthesiologists and the Area Health Resource File. Study Design We use a matching difference‐in‐difference regression which contrasts the change in work patterns for anesthesiologists in California, which dropped supervision requirements, to the change for similar anesthesiologists. Key outcome variables include the number of weekly hours worked, the type of work done, and type of care delivery teams. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Self‐reported national survey data drawn from members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Principal Findings Anesthesiologists in California saw no change in time spent working or time spent supervising CRNAs. There was a decrease in direct care clinical work hours along with a shift in working more in intraoperative care, a decrease in postoperative care, and an increase in the percentage of cases supervising residents. Conclusions Anesthesiologists had small but real responses to California’s decisions to opt‐out of the physician supervision requirement for CRNAs, doing more work in intraoperative care and less outside of the operating room.

We compare years of learning to three other translation options: benchmarking against other effect sizes, converting to percentile growth, and estimating the probability of scoring above a proficiency threshold. After enumerating the desirable properties of translations, we examine each option’s strengths and weaknesses. We conclude that years of learning performs worst, and percentile gains performs best, making it our recommended choice for more interpretable translations of standardized effects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="martsolf_relationship_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Relationship between state policy and anesthesia provider supply in rural communities</div> <div class="author"> Grant R.

Lower supply in rural communities raises concerns about access to procedures that require anesthesia in rural areas. State policies related to certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) practice may help to alleviate rural supply concerns. Objectives: To estimate the association between state CRNA policy and anesthesia provider supply especially in rural communities. Research Design: Repeated cross-sectional design using ordinary least squares and 2-stage least squares regressions. Subjects: All counties in the United States from 2010 to 2015. Measures: Dependent variables include anesthesia provider counts per 100,000 people, calculated separately for anesthesiologists, CRNAs, and their sum. Key variables of interest include state-level CRNA policy based on scope of practice (SOP) regulations and Medicare opt-out status. Results: Opt-out status and less restrictive SOP regulations were consistently correlated with a greater supply of CRNAs, especially in rural counties. Furthermore, we found that anesthesiologists and CRNAs tend to be complements to each other, but less restrictive SOP and opt-out status tend to weaken the importance of this relationship. Conclusions: State regulations may lead to increased supply of CRNAs in rural communities. However, the design of our study makes causality difficult to assert. So, it is also possible that states set CRNA policy as a response to counts of anesthesia providers in rural areas. Furthermore, given supply of anesthesiologists and CRNAs are complementary to one another, improving access to anesthesia services may require addressing issues pertaining to the supply of all anesthesia provider types.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baird_effectiveness_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effectiveness of screened, demand-driven job training programs for disadvantaged workers: An evaluation of the New Orleans Career Pathway training</div> <div class="author"> Matthew D.

However, the literature shows evidence that such decisions at least partly depend on nonwage benefits encompassed in jobs and occupations. In this paper, I develop and estimate a stochastic dynamic model of occupation and job choice, where nonwage benefits are directly incorporated into the decision alongside wages (a full model). Nested within the full model is a wage model, which represents the common practice in the literature of basing selection solely on wages and disregarding nonwage benefits. I separately estimate the full model and the nested wage model to compare the implications (biases) of omitting nonwage benefits. I compare the two models’ estimates of elasticities and an inequality reduction intervention policy. I find that disregarding nonwage benefits generally causes biases. There are cases when the two models predict very similar outcomes and have close estimates, such as in occupation‐specific elasticities and job transition elasticities. But these special cases are products of canceling biases. In most cases, ignoring nonwage benefits will bias estimates by overestimating the importance of wage in the selection process and by disregarding changes in relative prices between wage and nonwage benefits.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baird_postsecondary_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Postsecondary education and STEM employment in the United States: An analysis of national trends with a focus on the natural gas and oil industry</div> <div class="author"> Matthew D.

I conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study for various orders of kernels in the Gaussian family and compare the new cross validation criterion with those implied by Baird [Cross validation bandwidth selection for derivatives of multidimensional densities. RAND Working Paper series, WR-1060; 2014]. The paper finds that higher order kernels become increasingly important as the dimension of the distribution increases. I find that the cross validation criterion developed in this paper that jointly estimates the derivative of the joint density (numerator) and the marginal density (denominator) does orders of magnitude better than criteria that estimate the bandwidths separately.

In addition, many changes have occurred in the economy, demographics, and the healthcare sector in the last few years, which may impact the workforce. The authors documented workforce trends by region of the United States and gender, trends that may have implications for the supply and demand of anesthesiologists. Methods The authors conducted a national survey of American Society of Anesthesiologists members (accounting for \textgreater80% of all practicing anesthesiologists in the United States) in 2007 and repeated it in 2013. The authors used logistic regression analysis and Seemingly Unrelated Regression to test across several indicators under an overarching hypothesis. Results Anesthesiologists in Western states had markedly different patterns of practice relative to anesthesiologists in other regions in 2007 and 2013, including differences in employer type, the composition of anesthesia teams, and the time spent on monitored anesthesia care. The number and proportion of female anesthesiologists in the workforce increased between 2007 and 2013, and females differed from males in employment arrangements, compensation, and work hours. Conclusions Regional differences remained stable during this time period although the reasons for these differences are speculative. Similarly, how and whether the gender difference in work hours and shift to younger anesthesiologists during this period will impact workforce needs is uncertain.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="pane_continued_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Continued progress: Promising evidence on personalized learning</div> <div class="author"> John F.
